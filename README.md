## Linux Security and Vulnerabilities: Stats

Compared to other operating systems like Windows and macOS, Linux has fewer vulnerabilities. However, Linux is not immune to all types of cyberattacks. The most common vulnerabilities in Linux systems are privilege escalation, memory corruption, and information disclosure. Cyber attackers use these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to a Linux system and steal data.

Reports from sources such as  [The National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/)  and  [Crowdstrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/)  show an increase in Linux vulnerabilities each year. For example, there were 1,958 Linux vulnerabilities reported in 2020. In 2021, there was a 35% rise in malware targeting Linux systems compared to 2020. And in 2022, the number of new Linux malwares reached nearly 1.7 million, a 650% increase from the previous year.

Significant  Linux ransomwares and vulnerabilities over the years are:

1.  **Shellshock (2014 - active)**. A vulnerability in the  Bash shell  that lets attackers run random code by running a specially prepared environment variable.
2.  **Ghost (2015 - resolved)**. A vulnerability in the  GNU  C Library (glibc) that allowed attackers to run arbitrary code by sending a specific DNS response.
3.  **Dirty COW (2016 -  **resolved**)**. This vulnerability affected the  Linux kernel and gave attackers  root access  by exploiting a race condition in the  memory management  system.
4.  **BlueBorne (2017 -  **resolved**)**. This vulnerability affected Bluetooth implementations on Windows, Linux, and Android. BlueBorne would run the code remotely, allowing the attackers to steal sensitive information.
5.  **SACK Panic (2019 -  **resolved**)**. A vulnerability in the  TCP stack of the Linux kernel caused a denial of service by sending TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) packets.
6.  **Ghostcat (2020 -  **active**)**. This vulnerability affects the  Apache Tomcat web server and allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
7.  **SUDO (2021 -  **active**)**. This vulnerability affected the  sudo  command-line utility and allowed attackers to execute commands as root without a password.
8.  **Text4Shell or ACT4Shell (2022 -  **active**)**. A critical  remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability that abuses the Apache Commons Text interpolation functionality in  string substitution .
9.  **Linux Kernel Vulnerability (2023 -  **active**).**  A security issue was found in the Linux kernel's NVMe functionality, specifically in the  **`nvmet_setup_auth()`**  function, which can result in a pre-auth  denial of service (DoS) attack   on a remote machine.
10.  **Signal Desktop Vulnerability (2023 -  **active**)**. A vulnerability in the Signal Desktop software allows attackers access to sensitive message attachments.

## Securing and Hardening Linux Server

In an age where cyber threats are ever-evolving, securing and hardening Linux servers has become a critical aspect of IT infrastructure management. This project aims to reinforce the security of Linux servers by implementing a comprehensive set of best practices and advanced techniques. The project's scope includes identifying potential vulnerabilities, configuring firewall rules, enforcing strong authentication mechanisms, and employing system monitoring tools to detect and mitigate threats in real-time.
