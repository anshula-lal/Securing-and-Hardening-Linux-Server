## Linux Security and Vulnerabilities: Stats

Compared to other operating systems like Windows and macOS, Linux has fewer vulnerabilities. However, Linux is not immune to all  [types of cyberattacks](https://phoenixnap.com/blog/types-of-cyber-attacks). The most common vulnerabilities in Linux systems are privilege escalation, memory corruption, and information disclosure. Cyber attackers use these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to a Linux system and steal data.

Reports from sources such as  [The National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/)  and  [Crowdstrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/)  show an increase in Linux vulnerabilities each year. For example, there were 1,958 Linux vulnerabilities reported in 2020. In 2021, there was a 35% rise in malware targeting Linux systems compared to 2020. And in 2022, the number of new Linux malwares reached nearly 1.7 million, a 650% increase from the previous year.

Significant  [Linux ransomwares](https://phoenixnap.com/blog/linux-ransomware)  and vulnerabilities over the years are:

1.  **Shellshock (2014 - active)**. A vulnerability in the  [Bash shell](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-shells)  that lets attackers run random code by running a specially prepared environment variable.
2.  **Ghost (2015 - resolved)**. A vulnerability in the  [GNU](https://phoenixnap.com/glossary/what-is-gnu)  C Library (glibc) that allowed attackers to run arbitrary code by sending a specific  [DNS response](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/what-is-domain-name-system-works).
3.  **Dirty COW (2016 -  **resolved**)**. This vulnerability affected the  [Linux kernel](https://phoenixnap.com/glossary/what-is-a-kernel)  and gave attackers  [root access](https://phoenixnap.com/glossary/what-is-root-access)  by exploiting a race condition in the  [memory management](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/memory-management)  system.
4.  **BlueBorne (2017 -  **resolved**)**. This vulnerability affected Bluetooth implementations on Windows, Linux, and Android. BlueBorne would run the code remotely, allowing the attackers to steal sensitive information.
5.  **SACK Panic (2019 -  **resolved**)**. A vulnerability in the  [TCP](https://phoenixnap.com/glossary/transmission-control-protocol-tcp)  stack of the Linux kernel caused a denial of service by sending TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) packets.
6.  **Ghostcat (2020 -  **active**)**. This vulnerability affects the  [Apache Tomcat](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-tomcat-ubuntu)  web server and allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
7.  **SUDO (2021 -  **active**)**. This vulnerability affected the  [sudo](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-sudo-command)  command-line utility and allowed attackers to execute commands as root without a password.
8.  **Text4Shell or ACT4Shell (2022 -  **active**)**. A critical  [remote code execution (RCE)](https://phoenixnap.com/glossary/remote-code-execution-rce)  vulnerability that abuses the Apache Commons Text interpolation functionality in  [string substitution](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/sed-replace).
9.  **Linux Kernel Vulnerability (2023 -  **active**).**  A security issue was found in the Linux kernel's NVMe functionality, specifically in the  **`nvmet_setup_auth()`**  function, which can result in a pre-auth  [denial of service (DoS) attack](https://phoenixnap.com/blog/prevent-ddos-attacks)  on a remote machine.
10.  **Signal Desktop Vulnerability (2023 -  **active**)**. A vulnerability in the Signal Desktop software allows attackers access to sensitive message attachments.
